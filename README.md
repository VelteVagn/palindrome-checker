# Palindrome
I read half a post on LinkedIn claiming that when hiring software engineers, this company (or person) relied heavily on one question: "Can you make a program checking whether or not a positive integer N>0 is a palindrome WITHOUT using strings?". Now I didn't want any clues, so I didn't read the whole post, and then I lost it. So I don't know if there was some "trick" to it, or any othereason they'd ask this question. There are two versions; one using pure math, another utilising lists. However, it felt like the latter would be cheating, and that they were looking for the other solution, but I wouldn't know.
